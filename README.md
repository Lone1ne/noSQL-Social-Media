# noSQL Social Media

## Description

This software is the backend for a social media application. It enables users to retireve, create, update, and delete both 'users' and 'thoughts' stored in a MongoDB database. It also allows for the creation and deletion of 'reactions' toward a 'thought' and allows users to connect with other users by adding them to their friend list. To ensure all of the application routes are functioning as expected the routes have been thoroughly tested using Insomnia.
